## What Can I Do For You?

I work with organizations, teams, and individuals to clarify your communication goals and develop a strategy that gets you where you want to go.
When you bring me in, I’ll assess what’s working, identify the gaps, and deliver a tailored package of messaging and content that help you reach your goals — clearly, effectively, and with your audience in mind.


### Core Services

- **Strategy and Planning**  
  I’ll review your content ecosystem, audit what's working, and develop a roadmap to align content with your brand and audience needs.
 
- **Messaging and Content Packages**  
  Includes marketing materials, website content, newsletters, executive messaging, campaign copy, or storytelling frameworks — all tailored to your voice, audience, and goals.

- **AI Integration for Teams**  
  Many workplaces feel the pressure to use AI, but don’t have a clear path forward and are overwhelmed. People are too busy to learn about and use new tools.  
  I help teams build literacy, explore the tools that fit their needs, and use AI to create better, more efficient content — with intention, not urgency.

## About Katy

I’m a communications strategist with a proven record of helping organizations clarify complex ideas and connect with the people they serve.
My background spans government, global health, public service, mission-driven work, and small business needs — including projects with CDC, USAID, Deloitte, Peace Corps, University of Washington, and Johns Hopkins. I’ve worked across six countries and three continents, always focused on making communication more effective, accessible, and meaningful.
I’ve helped teams define their core messages, write for multiple audiences, and manage the content needed for newsletters, websites, and campaigns. I’ve also led training sessions and supported teams as they adapt and evolve to the latest tech and trends to improve their impact.
I don’t overpromise. I help you figure out what’s essential, what’s working, and what needs to change — then I help you do something about it.


### Areas of Focus
  - Health communications  
  - AI-assisted writing  
  - Behavior change and audience motivation  
  - Content ecosystems and multichannel use

### How I Work  
I have a bias for action — direct, focused, and outcome-driven. I'm committed to producing high-quality work and bring:

## Featured Work
Over the course of my career, I’ve created varied products from educational documentaries, social media campaigns, and personal storytelling to newsletters, website overhauls, and fact sheets. I’ve also designed and delivered training.
These sample projects reflect a blend of content strategy, messaging development, and AI-assisted delivery.


### 🟪 Black Maternal Health Week (BMHW) Campaign  
For this comprehensive, multi-channel effort that drove hundreds of toolkit downloads, strengthened partnership, and raised awareness of this critical public health issue, I produced/edited videos, wrote personal narratives, social media and newsletter copy, and managed our vendor who produced the graphics package. During the campaign period, the BMHW webpage became the most-visited page on the agency’s site.

### 🟪 “A Family’s Journey” – Storytelling for Systems Change  
I wrote this narrative to humanize the Family-to-Family (F2F) Health Information Center program for Congressional decision-makers, support centers in telling their story, and inform families about available help. The story follows one family’s experience navigating complex medical, educational, and everyday challenges, and the critical support they received from their F2F center.

### 🟪 “This Is Destiny” – The Power of Doula Care for Better Health Outcomes  
A mom, a doula, and a powerful birth story. I wrote this feature to highlight how community-based doulas build trust, prepare families, and improve delivery experiences.

### 🟪 National Survey of Children’s Health – Branding Video  
I designed this video to raise awareness of the National Survey of Children’s Health and strengthen public trust in the agency behind it. The video was designed to reinforce credibility, explain the purpose of the survey in plain terms, and encourage participation from parents and caregivers.

### 🟦 Emergency Evacuation Plan (AI-Assisted)  
For a high-profile production filming on location, I developed an emergency evacuation plan tailored to the geography and complex personnel needs. AI tools accelerated concept-to-delivery by an estimated 70%.
