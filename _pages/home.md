<h2>What I Can Do for You</h2>
<p>I work with organizations, teams, and individuals to clarify your communication goals and develop a strategy that gets you where you want to go.

When you bring me in, I’ll assess what’s working, identify the gaps, and deliver a tailored package of messaging, content, and tools that help you reach your goals — clearly, effectively, and with your audience in mind.</p>

<h3>Core Services</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
 <h4>🟣 Messaging & Content Packages</h4><br>
    Includes marketing materials, website content, newsletters, executive messaging, campaign copy, or storytelling frameworks — all tailored to your voice, audience, and goals.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>🟣 Content Strategy & Planning</h4><br>
    I’ll review your content ecosystem, audit what's working, and develop a roadmap to align content with your brand and audience needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>🟣 AI Integration & Team Training</h4><br>
    Many workplaces feel the pressure to use AI, but don’t have a clear path forward and are overwhelmed. I help teams build literacy, explore the tools that fit their needs, and use AI to create better, more efficient content — with intention, not urgency.
  </li>

<!-- About -->
<section id="about">
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I’m a communications strategist with a proven record of helping organizations clarify complex ideas and connect with the people they serve.</p>

<p>My background spans government, global health, public service, mission-driven work, and small business needs — including projects with CDC, USAID, Deloitte, Peace Corps, University of Washington, and Johns Hopkins. I’ve worked across six countries and three continents, always focused on making communication more effective, accessible, and meaningful.</p>

<p>I’ve helped teams define their core messages, write for multiple audiences, and manage the content needed for newsletters, websites, and campaigns. I’ve also led training sessions and supported teams as they adapt to organizational needs or new tools — like AI — to improve their workflows and outcomes.</p>

<p>I don’t overpromise. I help you figure out what’s essential, what’s working, and what needs to change — then I help you do something about it.</p>

<h2>Training</h2>
<p>Need help getting practical in this evolving AI landscape? Struggle with helping your teams to write clearly and effectively? Looking for someone to help enable your nontechnical teams to use AI tools and understand what they can and can’t quite do?</p>

<p>I can help! Feel free to get in touch.</p>
<p>📬 <a href="mailto:forwardstory@gmail.com">forwardstory@gmail.com</a></p>

<h3>Offerings Include</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
 <h4>🟣 Write It Clearly: Training for Teams (with AI-Enhanced Support)</h4><br>
    Helps teams write clearly and confidently — with or without AI tools. You’ll learn how to turn complex ideas into accessible, actionable content, and how to use GenAI to support your process, not replace it.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>🟣 Storytelling: Craft Messages That Stick, Scale, and Inspire</h4><br>
    Helps teams and individuals bring their mission, products, or services to life with compelling, structured stories. You’ll learn how to connect messaging to audience needs, organize your ideas for clarity and flow, and use GenAI to prototype content quickly — without losing your voice.

  </li>
  <li>
    <h4>🟣 AI-Literacy for Nontechnical Teams: Be the Human in the Loop</h4><br>
    This session is for people who don’t build AI — but are expected to use it. I offer a plain-language overview of generative AI, what it’s good at (and not), and how to think critically about using it in your daily work.
The goal isn’t to revolutionize your processes — it’s to help your team use AI tools more thoughtfully, improve your outputs, and stay alert to the limits and risks. You’ll walk away with a practical, no-hype understanding of where these tools fit in your work.
  </li>
