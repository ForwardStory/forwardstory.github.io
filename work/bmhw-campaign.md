## Campaign Evolution

### 2023: Building the Foundation
HRSA's inaugural Black Maternal Health Week campaign focused on doula care and its impact on maternal health outcomes. The approach centered on authentic storytelling through user-generated video content and a partner photo contest that engaged the broader community in visual narrative-building.  

### 2024: Expanding Impact
The second year marked a significant expansion with a comprehensive, multi-channel approach that set new standards for HRSA's public health campaigns. The Vice President’s Office, HHS, HUD, state public health agencies, and community-based organizations engaged in the social media campaign.  

> **Core Content: Four two-minute video vignettes, each paired with written stories:**  
> - Research excellence in maternal health  
> - Healthy Start Program community impact, featuring the importance of fatherhood  
> - Home Visiting Services and personalized care  
> - Maternal Mental Health Hotline, featuring a personal postpartum depression journey

## Centering Lived Experience

A defining element of the 2024 campaign was bringing story participants into a pre-launch meeting with HRSA staff. This approach went beyond featuring people’s experiences — it demonstrated genuine partnership and respect for the communities being served. The meeting allowed participants to connect directly with staff while showing institutional commitment to community-centered work.
