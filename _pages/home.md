Across 3 continents and 6 countries, I‚Äôve served clients and teams across the government, academic, private, and global health sectors‚Äîincluding CDC, Deloitte, USAID, Peace Corps, University of Washington, and Johns Hopkins‚Äîby translating complex ideas into clear, human-centered narratives. My approach is grounded in integrity, creativity, and service to people.</p>

I‚Äôve also led training sessions and supported teams as they adapt to organizational needs or new tools ‚Äî like AI ‚Äî to improve their workflows and outcomes.</p>

    <p>I don‚Äôt overpromise. I help you figure out what‚Äôs essential, what‚Äôs working, and what needs to change ‚Äî then I help you do something about it.</p>
